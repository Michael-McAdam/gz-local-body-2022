        <h1> Our scorecarding process </h1>
        <p>
          The final scores were based on a combination of the answers given by
          the candidates via our survey and voting records (for incumbents) or
          publicly known information.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were five marked sections - scale, multiple choice, explain your
          answer, yes/no, and regional. For each section, the candidates were
          able to explain their answers at the bottom of the page if they wish.
          Their explanations or comments were taken into account when marking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The questions do not have equal weighting on the final scoring, and
          the weightings change based on the regions. We did the final scoring
          on five wider themes:{" "}
          <b>Environment, Transport, Te Tiriti, Equity/Social Welfare, </b> and{" "}
          <b>Housing/Liveable Cities</b>, and then these scores were weighed to
          create a final grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          All questions are optional, but skipping questions did result in lower
          or zero marks. Candidates were able to leave and come back to the
          questionnaire at any point before submitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been supported in the creation of our scorecard. We want to
          thank many groups and individuals for helping with the writing of our
          survey questions:{" "}
